# todo-list
Yet another To-do list app to keep track of your daily tasks. 

In this nature themed app, you are able to organise to "grow" your tasks, each organised into projects.

### Features:
- Add checklist items to each todo-item
- Set date and due dates
- Assign a priority level (low, medium, high)
- Assign tags to each item
- Add item notes
- Make changes to your item or delete them

### Dev Dependencies
- Webpack for JS bundling

### Tech Stack
Front-end: vanilla ES6 JavaScript.

Back-end: this app uses `Firestore` to save and retrieve items from their respective projects (as a `document`). 

`Webpack` is used to bundle JS.

Note: as this app was created before the author was aware of React (or any other frontend framework), it does make use of location.reload to refresh elements on the page. Users be warned.
